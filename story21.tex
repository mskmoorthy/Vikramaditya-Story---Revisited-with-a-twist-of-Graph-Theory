\chapter{Conclusion}
Rishnak used to teach at a college in Royt. He was such a mean teacher that his students landed a curse on him such that he would remain a ghost until a student whom he teaches appreciates his teaching. Shortly after Ajur thanked Rishnak, Rishnak was released from his curse.  He could now join his own ancestors in the other world. Rishnak was also happy that young Ajur was not afraid of failure and instead persevered to understand and solve all of the hard problems he faced. To show his appreciation to Ajur, Rishnak presented Ajur with a pet monkey named Ruele and Ajur was ecstatic.
