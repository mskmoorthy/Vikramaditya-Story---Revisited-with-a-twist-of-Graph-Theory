\chapter{Conclusion}
 Rishnak used to teach in a college in Royt. He was such a mean 
teacher that his students cursed him that he will be a ghost till he teaches a young student and the student
appreciates his efforts in teaching. As soon as Ajur thanked Rishnak, Rishnak was relieved. He then could join his ancestors in the other world. Rishnak was also happy that Ajur was able to persist on hard problems and was not afraid of failures.
