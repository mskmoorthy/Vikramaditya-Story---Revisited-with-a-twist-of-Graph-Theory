\chapter{Conclusion}
 Rishnak used to teach in a college in Royt. He was such a mean 
teacher that his students cursed him that he would remain a ghost till any student whom he teaches 
appreciates his teaching. As soon as Ajur thanked Rishnak, Rishnak was then released from his curse. He could join his own ancestors in the other world. Rishnak was also happy that young Ajur was not afraid of failure but persevered to understand and solve on hard problems.
