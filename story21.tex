\chapter{Conclusion}
 Rishnak used to teach in a college in Royt. He was such a mean 
teacher that his students cursed him that he will be a ghost till he teaches a young student well enough that the student
appreciates his efforts in teaching. As soon as Ajur thanked Rishnak, Rishnak was then released from his curse. He could move on to the world of ancestors and join his own ancestors. Rishnak was also happy that young Ajur was not afraid of failure but persevered to understand and solve on hard problems.
