\chapter{Graph Isomorphism, Subgraph Isomorphism and Ulam's Conjecture}

Rishnak was frantically looking for Ajur as he wanted to Ajur and share with him some important concepts. Finally he found Ajur and Jura walking along the bank of a pond in the cemetery. Rishnak told Ajur that we have been talking about Graphs and some times, we label the vertices and sometimes we do not label the vertices. Rishnak told Ajur that the graph with vertices labeled is called a labeled graph and the one without labels is called unlabeled graphs. Two labeled graphs are equivalent if they are identical- all the edges have the same labels. Here are two labeled graphs that are equivalent see Figurea \ref{8g1} and \ref{8g11}. Graph see Figure \ref{8g2} is not equivalent to either Graph \ref{8g1} or \ref{8g11} ad in Graph \ref{8g2} there is no edge between vertices 4 and 5.

Two graphs are isomorphic (structurally the same), if they are equivalent under vertex relabeling. So if in Graph \ref{8g2} vertex 2 is relabeled as 3 and vertex 3 is relabeled as 2, the two graphs \ref{8g2} and \ref{8g1} are equivalent. If a graph,$G$, is equivalent to a graph $H$ and $H$ is equivalent to another graph $P$, then $G$ is equivalent to graph $P$\footnote{Equivalence relation is transitive.}.
