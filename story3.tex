\chapter{Subgraphs}
Rishnak found Ajur sleeping with his dog Jura near the cemetery. Rishnak noticed that a headstone had the name Schossow. Rishnak recognized the name  from Instant Insanity Puzzle{\footnote{It is also known as Katzenjammer, (Great) Tantalizer, Face-4, Cube-4, Bognar Balls, Taktikolor, Frantic, Diabolical, Damblocks,
Symington's Puzzle. A patent was awarded to  Schossow in 1990}}. Rishnak thought it would be an interesting topic to discuss with Ajur.  At that very moment, Jura, the dog, was eager to wake up Ajur. Ajur woke up and took Jura along a path when Rishnak startled Ajur. 

Rishnak asked Ajur what he knew about subgraphs. Ajur said that he was familiar with subsets. Since a graph has both a vertex set and edge set, he can deduce what a subgraph is. If a graph $G=(V,E)$ with a vertex set $V$ and an edge set $E$, then take any subset $X$ of $V$ and consider all the edges in E, which has both its end vertices in $X$. Ajur drew this.

If one took a vertex subset $\{1,2,3,5\}$, of Figure \ref{3g} the subgraph could be as in Figure \ref{3g1}.

Rishnak laughed and said that the subgraph you drew is called an \textit {induced subgraph} --- that is, all the edges are included in the vertex subset. You have the flexibility of choosing only a subset of these edges. But for all the chosen subset of edges, end vertices should be in the the chosen vertex subset.

Rishnak illustrated this with the following subgraph example as shown in Figure \ref{3g2}. A subgraph with no vertices and no edges is also an induced subgraph (and subgraph) of any graph.


%Rishnak said that in a graph having $n$ vertices where the vertices are labeled (have a number/name associated with them), then there are at least $2^n$ subgraphs and exactly $2^n$ induced subgraphs.  There are ${n \choose i}$ ways of choosing $i$ vertices from a given set of $n$ vertices. Once the vertices are chosen, the edges are fixed for an induced subgraph. Since $i$ can vary from 0 to $n$, we get $2^n$ induced subgraphs. Since every induced subgraph is a subgraph (and not every subgraph is not an induced subgraph), we have at least $2^n$ subgraphs.  

A walk from a vertex $i$ to a vertex $j$ is an alternating sequence of vertices and edges. Every edge in that walk is incident between vertices preceding and succeeding that edge. For example in Figure \ref{3g},
a walk from vertex 6 to vertex 1 could be 6 (6,4), 4, (4,3), 3, (3,2), 2, (2,1) and 1. The edges are represented as a vertex pair. If those edges are labelled with a name, that label could be used instead. Another walk in Figure \ref{3g} from vertex. 6 to vertex 1 could be 6, (6,4), 4, (4,5), 5 (5,1), 1.  The only other condition that the walk has (besides edge being incident on preceding and succeeding vertex), all the edges have to be distinct. However the vertices in a walk could be repeated. 
Here is another example Figure \ref{3g3}. A walk from vertex 1 and vertex 8 could be 1, (1,2), 2, (2,4), 4, (4,6), 6, (6,8). 8. (8,2), 2, (2,3), 3, (3,4), 4, (4,5), 5, (5,6), 6, (6,7), 7, (7,8) and 8. Ajur was getting bored. He interjected that in your walk you have visited all the edges in the graph (shown in Figure \ref{3g3}). Ajur further added that this was similar to the K\"{o}nigsberg Bridge Problem (Figure \ref{kon} mentioned earlier in Chapter 3!).

    \draw (\from) -- (\to);

If the starting and ending vertices in a walk are the same, it is known as a closed walk. If all the edges in a closed walk are distinct, then it is known as a cycle. Ajur had heard of this from his friends.
Rishnak asked Ajur to list two cycles from Figure \ref{3g3}. Ajur had no trouble at all, in listing two cycles as (1,(1,2),2,(2,8),8,(8,1),1) and (2,(2,4),4,(4,6),6,(6,8),8,(8,2)2). Often the edges are omitted, and the cycles are written as (1,2,8,1) and (2,4,6,8,2).  Of course, a cycle and a walk are examples of subgraphs with some added conditions. These added conditions make the study of subgraphs very interesting. If in a cycle, all the vertices of the original graph is present, then that cycle is known as a Hamiltonian Cycle. For example in Figure \ref{3g3} the cycle (1,2,3,4,5, 6,7,8, 1) is a Hamiltonian Cycle Figure \ref{3g4}. If all the edges in a walk are distinct then it is known as a path. Ajur gave the following examples for a path in Figure \ref{3g3} as (1,(1,2),2,(2,3), 3) or simply as (1,2,3) Figure \ref{3g5}. If there is a path between every pair of vertices in a subgraph, then the subgraph is said to be connected. If a subgraph contains no cycles and connected, the subgraph is a tree. If such a tree contains all vertices then it is known as spanning tree Figure \ref{3g6}.  A subgraph in which the degree of every vertex is 1, then that subgraph is called a matching. Here is an example of a subgraph (which is a matching for Figure \ref{3g3}) in Figure \ref{3g7}. If the subgraph contains all vertices and the degree of every vertex is one, then it is called as Perfect matching. Here is an example of a subgraph that is a perfect matching for Figure in \ref{3g3} in Figure \ref{3g8}. Rishnak asked Ajur how many perfect matchings are there in Figure \ref{3g3}. Ajur thought a bit. He saw vertices 1, 3, 5 and 7 hae degree 2. Hence one of those incident on 1, 3, 5 and 7 have to be selected. Hence he replied that there are exactly two perfect matchings in Figure \ref{3g3}.

A graph is connected if there is a path between every pair of vertices in that graph. Otherwise the graph is disconnected,  Here is an example of a connected graph Figure \ref{3g9}. Here is an example of a graph that is not connected Figure \ref{3g10}

Ajur was getting restless as was Jura. Rishnak noticed that and called it a day.
