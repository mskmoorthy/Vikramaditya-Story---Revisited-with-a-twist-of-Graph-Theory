\chapter{Planar Graphs}
Ajur was so enamored by Hamiltonian cycles, he was eager to meet Rishnak and hear more about them. Rishnak was eager to talk to Ajur about drawing of graphs.
A planar graph is one in which no edges cross other than at
the vertices. There exists at least one drawing in which the edges do not cross.
If there is no such drawing available for a graph, then it is a non-planar graph.
For example here are two drawings of a complete graph on four vertices $K_4$. Since Figure \ref{9g2} has no edge crossing, we can call $K_4$ a planar graph.

 Rishnak showed another graph \ref{9g3} and asked Ajur whether he can draw it with no edges crossing.
 \begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
  [scale=.3,auto=left,every node/.style={circle,fill=red!20}]
  \node (n1) at (1,7) {1};
  \node (n2) at (5,7)  {2};
  \node (n3) at (1,2)  {3};
  \node (n4) at (5,2) {4};
  \node (n5) at (9,2)  {5};
 
  
   \foreach \from/\to in {n1/n3,n1/n4,n1/n5,n2/n3,n2/n4,n2/n5}
    \draw (\from) -- (\to);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\caption{ A Bipartite Graph with 5 vertices and 6 edges, denoted by $K_{2,3}$ where the edges cross}\label{9g3}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
Ajur thought for a while and found it a bit challenging. Then he thought of moving the vertex 2 down in which case no edges will cross. He drew the graph as shown in Figure \ref{9g4}
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
  [scale=.3,auto=left,every node/.style={circle,fill=red!20}]
  \node (n1) at (1,7) {1};
  \node (n2) at (5,-2)  {2};
  \node (n3) at (1,2)  {3};
  \node (n4) at (5,2) {4};
  \node (n5) at (9,2)  {5};
 
  
   \foreach \from/\to in {n1/n3,n1/n4,n1/n5,n2/n3,n2/n4,n2/n5}
    \draw (\from) -- (\to);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\caption{ Planar Drawing of a Bipartite Graph ($K{2,3}$ with 5 vertices and 6 edges with  no edge crossing}\label{9g4}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Impressed, Rishnak then asked Ajur whether this graph \ref{9g5} has a planar representation. Ajur struggled and tried to get a drawing - with one edge crossing \ref{9g6}. 

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
  [scale=.3,auto=left,every node/.style={circle,fill=red!20}]
  \node (n1) at (1,7) {1};
  \node (n2) at (5,7)  {2};
  \node (n3) at (9,7) {3};
  \node (n4) at (1,2)  {4};
  \node (n5) at (5,2) {5};
  \node (n6) at (9,2)  {6};
 
  
   \foreach \from/\to in {n1/n6,n1/n4,n1/n5,n2/n6,n2/n4,n2/n5,n3/n4,n3/n5,n3/n6}
    \draw (\from) -- (\to);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\caption{ A Bipartite Graph with 6 vertices and 9 edges, denoted by $K_{3,3}$ where the edges cross}\label{9g5}

  \node (n2) at (5,-2)  {2};
  \node (n3) at (7,3) {3};
  \node (n4) at (1,2)  {4};
  \node (n5) at (4,1) {5};
  \node (n6) at (11,3)  {6};
 
  
   \foreach \from/\to in {n1/n6,n1/n4,n1/n5,n2/n6,n2/n4,n2/n5,n3/n4,n3/n5,n3/n6}
    \draw (\from) -- (\to);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\caption{ A  drawing of Bipartite Graph with 6 vertices and 9 edges, denoted by $K_{3,3}$ where just two edges edges cross}\label{9g6}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
Rishnak then told Ajur that this graph does not have a planar representation. He added that this is a well known puzzle credited to Sam Loyd\footnote{Sam Lloyd is a famous American Recreational Mathematician who has contributed a lot of puzzles}. There are three houses (represented as circles) drawn on paper and below them three smaller circles representing gas, water, and electricity suppliers. The aim of the puzzle is to draw lines to get each utility into every house, without crossing over any line. Ajur reminded himself that he should read up on Loyd's puzzle books from his local library.

 Rishnak asked Ajur if two graphs $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic and if $G$ is planar, can you say $H$ is planar. Ajur said if $H$ is isomorphic to $G$, then each vertex corresponds to some vertex of $G$. By just relabeling the vertices of $G$ in its planar drawing, we get a planar drawing of $H$.
 
 Ajur then excitedly told Risnak that all trees have a planar representation\footnote{Ajur liked monkeys and monkeys liked trees.}. Rishnak answered that trees are easy to embed in a plane as there are
 no cycles. He added that there is a nice space filling planar representation of a tree shown in Figure \ref{9g7}.
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}    

 \begin{tikzpicture}[decoration=H-tree, very thick]
    \draw decorate { decorate { decorate { decorate { decorate { decorate { (0,0) -- (3,0) }}}}}};
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{ A planar drawing of a tree (which is self similar)}\label{9g7}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

One way to get a planar drawing is to embed the longest cycle in a plane and then try to place the rest of the vertices so that no edges cross each other. This cycle will divide the plane into two regions - inner region (inside the cycle) and outer region (outside the cycle). So the edges have to go either inside or outside. By trying out the possibilities, you can get a planar representation of a graph (if it exists). It is easier said than done. One can do an efficient method of placing the edges (without any backtracking) - Rishnak said some details are more complicated. 

Each region in a planar representation is also called a face. Euler discovered a remarkable formula concerning the number of edges, e, the number of vertices, n, and the number of faces, f as,
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:euler}
  f-e+v=2 
\end{equation}

 

Rishnak gave an intuitive explanation of this formula \ref{eqn:euler}. Since each region is a cycle and the external region (sometimes called an infinite region) is also a cycle. 
There are $n-1$ edges in a tree, the rest of $e-(n-1)$ edges will form a cycle. Each of these cycles correspond to an internal region or internal face, and there is one external face. Using this, Euler's equation \ref{eqn:euler} follows.
\begin{eqnarray}
    \label{eqn:cycles}
    internal faces&=&e-(n-1)\nonumber\\
    external face&=&1 \nonumber \\
    total faces&=& internal faces~+~external face \nonumber \\
    &=&e-n+2
\end{eqnarray}

Ajur said that he has done Platonic solids with Zometools \footnote{Zometool is a commercial kit to make polyhedrons}. Rishnak then explained Euler's equation applied for the five platonic solids by the following table \ref{tab:platonic} where $n$ stands for the number of vertices, $e$ stands for the number of edges and $f$ stands for the number of faces. All Platonic solids have a planar representations as shown in Figures \ref{fig:tetra}, \ref{fig:octa}, \ref{fig:cube}, \ref{fig:dod}, and \ref{fig:ico}.

Rishnak said each edge appears in exactly two faces. If each face is a triangle (cycle of length 3), it is called a maximal planar graph. Hence the number of edges, $e=\frac{3 \times f}{2}$ or $f=\frac{2 \times e}{3}$ . Substituting for $f$ in Euler equation \ref{eqn:euler}, we get

\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eqn:maxplanar}  
    \frac{2\times e}{3}&=&e-n+2\nonumber\\
    -\frac{e}{3} &=&-n+2\nonumber \\
    \frac{e}{3}&=&n-2 \nonumber \\
    e&=& 3 \times n - 6
\end{eqnarray}

Using this fact \ref{eqn:maxplanar}, it can be shown that the complete graph on 5 vertices, $K_5$ shown in Figure \ref{9g10} is nonplanar. That graph has $n$=5, $e$=10. If it were planar the number of edges has to be at most $9$. 
Rishnak asked Ajur how do you use Euler's equation to show that $K_{3,3}$, a complete bipartite graph on 6 vertices (discussed in Figure \ref{9g5}), is nonplanar. 
Ajur was alert and he knew that the bipratite graph has only even cycle lengths and to have maximum number of edges each face has to be of a cycle length 4. Hence $2\times e =4 \times f$ or $f=\frac{e}{2}$. Substituting for $f$ in Euler's equation \ref{eqn:euler}
$f=e-n+2$, one gets $-\frac{e}{2}=n-2$ or $e=2\times n -4$. Substituting for $n=6$, we get $e=8$. That is the maximum number possible. However, $K_{3,3}$ has 9 edges which is more than 8. Hence Ajur said $K_{3,3}$ is nonplanar.

  \node (n3) at (9,7)  {3};
  \node (n4) at (9,3) {4};
  \node (n5) at (1,3) {5};

  \foreach \from/\to in {n1/n2,n2/n3,n3/n4,n4/n5,n1/n5,n1/n3,n1/n4,n2/n4,n2/n5,n3/n5}
    \draw (\from) -- (\to);

\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{ Complete Graph, $K_5$ with 5 vertices and 10 edges }\label{9g10}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
Rishnak added another interesting fact (without adding any further details) that any planar graph has not only a plane representation but also a representation in which each edge is drawn as a straight line.

Ajur responded that every subraph of a planar graph is also a planar graph. Pleased to note that Ajur was following the concepts, Rishnak added that the operation of dividing an edge, i.e., introducing vertices of degree 2 will not change the embedding. If a graph is planar and if we subdivide an edge, it is still planar. Similarly if a graph is nonplanar, and if e subdivides any edge, the graph is still nonplanar. An example of subdivision of an edge is shown in Figure \ref{9g9}. Now Jura appeared to be getting restless and Rishnak decided that they have had enough for that session  so they parted for the night.
