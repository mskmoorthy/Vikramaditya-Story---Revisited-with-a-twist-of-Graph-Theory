\chapter{Instant Insanity Puzzle}

Rishnak was examining the headstones of some of the graves. He saw a headstone with a name Schossow \footnote{ Schossow got a ptent for proposing this puzzle in 1899\url{https://patents.google.com/patent/US646463A/en} }  in a grave. That brought him memories of the puzzle called the Great Tantalizer (also known as Instant Insanity).
Rishnak thought that was a great puzzle to tell Ajur as this puzzle have a nice graph theoretic solution.
