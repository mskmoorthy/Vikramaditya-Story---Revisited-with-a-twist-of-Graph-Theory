\chapter{Matching and Assignment Problem}

Ajur and Jura were startled to hear the footsteps behind them. They turned back and saw Rishnak standing. Rishnak said the edges analog of maximal independent set (set of non-adjacent vertices) is a maximal matching. Maximal matching is a set of edges that do not share any common end vertices. Rishnak showed a graph Figure \ref{16g1} and the maximal matching edges are colored red.

  (n9) to (n10);

\end{figure}

Since this is a maximal matching - every edge is incident at one of the end vertices of the edges in the Maximal set. Hence the vertices $\{1,2,4,6,7,8,9,10\}$ form a vertex cover. However the minimum vertex cover is $\{1,6,7,10\}$. If we find a Maximal matching we know the bound on the size of the minimum vertex cover!.


A perfect matching is a matching such that all the vertices are the end vertices of the edges in the matching. For example Figure \ref{16g1} does not have a perfect matching.  But consider the following graph Figure \ref{16g2}; this graph has a maximal matching and all the vertices are present as one of the end vertices of the edges in the maximal matching.

Rishnak gave some interesting tidbits about Matching Problem to Ajur.
A problem related to Matching got the Nobel prize in Economics in 2012 for Prof. Llyod Shapely and 
Prof. Alvin Roth.  Prof. David Gale and Prof. Shapely introduced a problem called Stable Marriage Problem (which we will describe next) and Prof. Alvin Roth applied this for variety of applications including medical resident assignment problem, kidney transplants. 

Stable Marriage Problem may be stated as follows:
Given $n$ males and $n$ females and a list of preferences for each male and female, find a stable marriage for the whole group.
A marriage is unstable if there are a male and female who are not married to each other but prefer each other to their respective spouses. Otherwise, the marriage is stable.
Consider the preferences for males \ref{16t1}and females\ref{16t2} as follows:
\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ |p{3cm}||p{1.5cm}||p{1.5cm} || p{1.5cm}|| }
 \hline
 \hline
 Male Name & First&Second&Third\\
 \hline
 Al  & Carla    &Ada&Bea\\
Bob&Ada&Bea&Carla\\
Caleb&Ada&Carla&Bea\\
 
 
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Male Preferences}\label{16t1}
\end{center}
\end{table}
\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ |p{3cm}||p{1.5cm}||p{1.5cm} || p{1.5cm}|| }
 \hline
 \hline
 Female Name & First&Second&Third\\
 \hline
 Ada  & Al    &Bob&Caleb\\
Bea&Caleb&Al&Bob\\
Carla&Al&Caleb&Bob\\
 
 
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Female Preferences}\label{16t2}
\end{center}
\end{table}

For this preferences the following marriage is stable (Al, Carla), (Bob, Ada) and (Caleb, Bea) as there are no unstable pairs.
However, (Al, Carla), (Bob, Bea) and (Caleb, Ada) is unstable marriage as Bob prefers Ada than Bea and Ada prefers Bob to Caleb.
Gale and Shapely showed that there is always a stable marriage pair for any preferences and they provided an elegant algorithm.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item In the first round, each male proposes to the female he prefers most.
    \item Each female replies "maybe" to her suitor she most prefers and "no" to all other suitors. She is temporarily "engaged" to the male she most prefers so far. 
    \item In subsequent round, each unengaged male proposes to the most-preferred female \footnote{Each male starts from his most preferred female to the least preferred} to whom he has not yet proposed (regardless of whether the female is already engaged).
    \item Each female replies "maybe" if she is currently not engaged or if she prefers this male over her current provisional partner\footnote{Based on her preferences} (in this case, she rejects her current provisional partner who becomes unengaged). The provisional nature of engagements preserves the right of an already-engaged female to "trade up" (and, in the process, to "jilt" her until-then partner).
   \item Repeat steps 3 and 4 until everyone is engaged
\end{enumerate}

Applying this procedure to example \ref{16t1} and \ref{16t2}, after the first round, Al is temporarily engaged to Carla and Bob is temporarily engaged to Ada (Both Bob and Caleb opts for Ada - but Ada prefers Bob to Caleb). Next round Caleb goes to Carla (who is temporarily engaged to Al). Since Carla prefers Al to Caleb, Caleb's offer is rejected. Now Caleb goes to Bea (as his last choice) and Bea takes Caleb as she did not have a suitor so far. So the algorithm terminates with the stable marriage pair of (Al, Carla), (Bob, Ada) and (Caleb, Bea). 

Ajur mentioned Rishnak that this algorithm reminded of him  like a musical chair assignment where males are searching for the females!

Rishnak said that thre is another application of a Matching problem is an Optimal Assignment Problem. 
Problem statement: Assign jobs to a group of workers and cost of each worker doing each job is give. Find an assignment of workers to jobs so as to minimize the total cost. This problem can be viewed as a bipartite graph with workers in one partition and jobs on the other partition. The edge from worker $i$ to job $j$ gives the cost of worker $i$ doing the job $j$.
We will assume that the number of workers is equal to the number of jobs ($n$).
\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ ||p{2cm}||p{2cm}||p{1.5cm} ||p{1.5cm}|| }
 \hline
 
  & Salesmanr&Tutor&Chef\\
 \hline
 Al  & 17   &40&45\\
 Bob& 23&60&35\\
 Caleb&21&40&25\\

 
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Cost Matrix - Rows are works and Columns are the jobs and Cost is given as a matirx }\label{16t3}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\begin{enumerate}
\item For each row of the matrix\footnote{matrix is a two dimensional array}, find the smallest element and subtract that from every element in its row.
\item Do the step 1 for all columns.
\item Cover all zeros in the matrix using minimum number of horizontal  and vertical lines.
\item If the minimum number of covering lines is n, an optimal assignment is possible and we are done. Else  proceed to step 5.
\item Determine the smallest entry not covered by any line. Subtract this entry from each uncovered row, and then add it to each covered column. Return to step 3.
\end{enumerate}

At the end of the first step we get Table \ref{16t4}
\begin{table}
\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \matrix (M)[matrix of math nodes,left delimiter={[},right delimiter={]}]{
     0&23&28\\
     0&37&12\\
     0&19&4\\
     };
     %\draw[thick,black](M-1-1.west)--(M-1-4.east);
     %\draw[thick,black](M-1-1.north)--(M-4-1.south);
     %\draw[thick,black](M-1-3.north)--(M-4-3.south);
  \end{tikzpicture}

\caption{At the end of first step }\label{16t4}
\end{center}
\end{table}
At the end of second step we get Table  \ref{16t5}
\begin{table}
\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \matrix (M)[matrix of math nodes,left delimiter={[},right delimiter={]}]{
     0&4&24\\
     0&18&8\\
     0&0&0\\
     };
     %\draw[thick,black](M-1-1.west)--(M-1-4.east);
     %\draw[thick,black](M-1-1.north)--(M-4-1.south);
     %\draw[thick,black](M-1-3.north)--(M-4-3.south);
  \end{tikzpicture}

\caption{At the end of second step }\label{16t5}
\end{center}
\end{table}

Since two lines cover all the zeros as shown in  Table \ref{16t6}
\begin{table}
\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \matrix (M)[matrix of math nodes,left delimiter={[},right delimiter={]}]{
     0&4&24\\
     0&18&8\\
     0&0&0\\
     };
     \draw[thick,black](M-3-1.west)--(M-3-3.east);
     \draw[thick,black](M-1-1.north)--(M-3-1.south);
     %\draw[thick,black](M-1-3.north)--(M-4-3.south);
  \end{tikzpicture}

\caption{Two lines cover all 0's}\label{16t6}
\end{center}
\end{table}

So we resort to step 5, taking the smallest entry among uncovered entries and do step 5 resulting in the following Tables \ref{16t7} and \ref{16t8} 
\begin{table}
\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \matrix (M)[matrix of math nodes,left delimiter={[},right delimiter={]}]{
     -4&0&20\\
     -4&14&4\\
     0&0&0\\
     };
     \draw[thick,black](M-3-1.west)--(M-3-3.east);
     \draw[thick,black](M-1-1.north)--(M-3-1.south);
     %\draw[thick,black](M-1-3.north)--(M-4-3.south);
  \end{tikzpicture}

\caption{Subtracting 4 from uncovered rows}\label{16t7}
\end{center}
\end{table}
\begin{table}
\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \matrix (M)[matrix of math nodes,left delimiter={[},right delimiter={]}]{
     0&0&20\\
     0&14&4\\
     4&0&0\\
     };
     \draw[thick,black](M-3-1.west)--(M-3-3.east);
     \draw[thick,black](M-1-1.north)--(M-3-1.south);
     %\draw[thick,black](M-1-3.north)--(M-3-3.south);
     %\draw[thick,black](M-1-1.north)--(M-3-1.south);
     %\draw[thick,black](M-1-2.north)--(M-3-2.south);
  \end{tikzpicture}

\caption{Adding 4 to covered columns }\label{16t8}
\end{center}
\end{table}

Now we have exactly three lines to cover all 0's as shown in Table \ref{16t9} and we are done. The assignment of Al to Tutor,
Bob to Salesman and Caleb to Chef with a total cost of 40+23+25=88. Ajur is more interested in why and how these procedures work. Rishnak said that it is way beyond even his knowledge and Ajur would learn it in college. Ajur nodded and Ajur and Jura left for a stroll. Rishnak was unhappy with himself that he did not study these things properly!
