\chapter{Matching and Assignment Problem}

Ajur and Jura were startled to hear the footsteps behind them. They turned back and saw Rishnak standing. Rishnak said the edges analog of maximal independent set (set of non-adjacent vertices) is a maximal matching. Maximal matching is a set of edges that do not share any common end vertices. Rishnak showed a graph Figure \ref{16g1} and the maximal matching edges are colored red.

Since this is a maximal matching - every edge is incident at one of the end vertices of the edges in the Maximal set. Hence the vertices $\{1,2,4,6,7,8,9,10\}$ form a vertex cover. However the minimum vertex cover is $\{1,6,7,10\}$. If we find a Maximal matching we know the bound on the size of the minimum vertex cover!.
