\chapter{Hamiltonian Path/Cycle}
Ajur was walking with Jura thinking what he could do to inspire a problem to be named after himself. Rishnak found Ajur to be an interesting youngster to discuss puzzles based on Graph Theory. After the discussion of the Eulerian Walk, Rishnak picked another closely related walk- namely Hamiltonian Path and Hamiltonian Cycle. Rishank approached Ajur and Jura and began defining the Hamiltonian Path and Hamiltonain walk.
In a Hamiltonian Path all the vertices are visited exactly once. 
The length of a path is the number of edges in that path. A Hamiltonian path in a graph with $n$ vertices will have a path length of $n-1$. A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that visits each vertex once and only once. The length of a Hamiltonian Cycle in a graph with $n$ vertices is $n$. Rishnak asked Ajur whether there is a Hamiltonian Cycle in the following graph Figure \ref{5g1},

Ajur thought about for a few seconds and he drew the Hamiltonian cycle of Figure \ref{5g1} in Figure \ref {5g2}. Krishnak told Ajur that his solution is not unique and there are more solutions!\footnote{Please find a Hamiltonian Cycle distinct from the one mentioned here}

Rishnak then told Ajur what led Hamilton to the statement of the Hamiltonian cycle problem. The mathematician Hamilton wanted a cycle to visit 
all the vertices of a Dodecahedron (another platonic solid, like cube) which has 20 vertices and 30 edges. 
Rishnak asked Ajur whether there is a Hamiltonian Cycle in this graph Figure \ref{5g3}. Rishnak added that this is a well known graph known as Petersen Graph.

Ajur thought for a while and he was not able to construct a Hamiltonian cycle. He however, was able to find a 
Hamiltonian Path. So he drew the following Figure \ref{5g4}. Rishnak mentioned to Ajur that this Hamiltonian path is not unique and there are other Hamiltonian paths.\footnote{Find a Hamiltonian path distinct from the one shown here.}

Rishnak assured Ajur that Petersen Graph does not have a Hamiltonian Cycle. Whether a graph has an Eulerian Cycle or not can easily be tested (the degree of every vertex has to be even), however, there is no easy way for test whether a given graph has a Hamiltonian cycle. 
Rishnak continued that there is a special class of graphs called bipartite graphs where every cycle is of even length. The vertex set can be partitioned into two sets $A$ and $B$, such that every edge in such a graph has one end vertex in $A$ and the other end vertex in $B$. Rishnak showed an example Figure \ref{5g5}. Ajur immediately said that all the cycles are of even lengths (4 and 6).\footnote{Every edge in the cycle must go from one partition to the other partition(they are the only possible edges)= hence the cycle length has to be even.} Rishnak asked Ajur what the two vertex partitions are (all the edges go from one partition to the other). After a little thought Ajur said one partition contains 1, 3, 5 and the other partition contains the vertices 2, 4 and 6. Ajur drew a graph (see Figure \ref{5g55}) to illustrate  what he meant. Ajur also mentioned that this graph has a Hamiltonian cycle. \footnote{Ajur exclaimed that every tree is a bipartite graph too, as a tree contains no cycles (or cycles of length 0 - we know that 0 is an even number!). Rishnak reminded Ajur that since tree does not have cycles and hence no Hamiltonian cycles.} 
Ajur wanted to show that he has understood the concept of bipartite graphs. So he drew a graph - see Figure \ref{5g6} that does not have a Hamiltonian cycle. Ajur explained why this graph does not have a Hamiltonian cycle. If there were a Hamiltonian cycle, the vertices in the cycle have to alternate between the two vertex partitions. But one vertex partition has two vertices and the other vertex partition has three vertices. Rishnak smiled and appreciated Ajur's logical thinking.

Rishnak then told Ajur about a problem he had heard in the radio program called Car Talk broadcast over the public radio. Here is a simplified version of the puzzle in the show.\footnote{ attributed to Bruce Robinson, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Tennessee} There are 9 jealous people who live in the squares of a three-by-three grid (see Figure \ref{5g7}. The squares are numbered, starting on the upper left-hand corner, 1 through 9. (going across one row at time or one column at a time or how?) Each person is jealous of his adjacent neighbor. Not his diagonal neighbor, but the person up or down or left or right of him. Each aspires to move into the apartment of his adjacent neighbor.
The question is very simple: What is the fewest number of total moves that can accomplish this?

\caption{ A three by three grid with nine apartments. Apartments are modeled as vertices and an edge denotes adjacency relation between apartments (up, down, two sides - not all apartments have all of the adjacent apartments} \label{5g7}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Ajur immediately figured  this is a bipratite graph and the partitions are not of equal size. Hence immediately he responded that this is not possible. Rishnak asked Ajur to write it so that his argument is tight. Ajur promised that he will do it by next day. This graph has a Hamiltonian path but not a Hamiltonian cycle. Ajur said that instead of three by three grid of apartments, if we had a four by three grid (or three by four grid) of apartments, it is easy for all of them to transfer to the adjacent apartments. Such a graph has a Hamiltonian Cycle.

Euler proposed a Knight's tour problem on a chessboard. A chessboard is an eight by eight square. Place a knight in any square. From that square, knight has to move\footnote{knight moves either two squares vertically up/down and one square horizontally left or right or one square vertically up or down and two squares horizontally left or right} visiting all squares once and only once. You can think of this as finding a Hamiltonian path in a 64 vertex graph with two vertices being adjacent if there is a knight move from one vertex to the other. There is no easy method of finding a knight's tour other than exhaustive search.\footnote{Usual method of exhaustive search is through backtracking - a systematic method of exploring all possibilities} Here is a solution Table \ref{5t1} for a five by five chess board with the knight's tour starting from bottom left.

Rishnak added that there are poems from different cultures (including India and China) based on Knight's tour. Ajur was intrigued and resolved to read and understand the poems. Rishnak added that one needs to verify that a knight's tour is impossible for a three by three chessboard or a four by four chessboard and warned that checking whether a knight's tour is impossible also takes a long time.

There are many methods to check whether a given graph has a Hamiltonian cycle. Unfortunately these conditions are \textbf{not} exhaustive. Rishnak taught Ajur a simple test to know whether a graph has a Hamiltonian cycle.

Rishnak stated the well known theorem that if the degree of every vertex in a graph with $n$ vertices is $\ge~\frac{n}{2}$, then the graph has a Hamiltonian cycle. Rishnak added that one can prove this theorem by Induction.\footnote{Proof by Induction is a powerful method for proving  statements.  First you prove a base case (in our case here Graph with three vertices). Then assume it is true for all $n~ \le ~k$ vertices and prove for $n~=~k+1$ vertices.} The base case with three vertices meeting the condition is a three vertex graph in which every vertex is connected to every other vertex - That is the only graph that satisfies the condition that the degree of every vertex is $\ge~\frac{3}{2}$. That graph has a Hamiltonian cycle. Assume that the hypothesis (a graph with $k$ vertices with degree of every vertex is $\ge~\frac{k}{2}$ has a Hamiltonian cycle) is true for graphs with vertices $\le~ k$ vertices. Let that Hamiltonian cycle be $v_i,v_{i+1},\cdots v_i$. Now consider a graph with $k+1$ vertices. The new vertex $v_{k+1}$ has to have a degree at least $\frac{k+1}{2}$.  The new vertex has to be adjacent to at least two adjacent vertices in that Hamiltonian cycle. For if it were not the degree of the new vertex will be $\le~\frac{k}{2}$. Since the new vertex is adjacent to two adjacent vertices (call them $v_l$ and $v_{l+1}$) in the Hamiltonian cycle of the graph with $k$ vertices. Now you can create a new Hamiltonian cycle in the $k+1$ vertex graph by $v_i,v_{i+1},\cdots,v_l,v_{k+1},v_{l+1},\cdots,v_i$. 

Ajur was able to follow along and loved the proof by Induction and the clever arguments used in the proof. But Jura who was patiently waiting was beginning to get restless so Ajur called it a day.
