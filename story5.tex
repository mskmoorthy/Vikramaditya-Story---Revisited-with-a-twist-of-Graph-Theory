\chapter{Hamiltonian Path/Cycle}
Ajur was walking with Jura thinking how a walk could be named after him. Rishnak found Ajur to be an interesting person to discuss puzzles related to Graph Theory. After the Eulerian Walk, Rishnak thought of another closely related walk- namely Hamiltonian Path and Hamiltonian Cycle. A Hamiltonian Path is a path in which all the vertices are visited exactly once. 
The length of a path is the number of edges in that path. A Hamiltonian path in a graph with $n$ vertices will have a path length of $n-1$, A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that visits each vertex once and only once. The length of Hamiltonian Cycle in a graph with $n$ vertices will have a length of $n$. Rishnak asked Ajur whether there is a Hamiltonian Cycle in the following graph Figure \ref{5g1},

    \draw (\from) -- (\to);

Ajur thought about for a few seconds and he drew the Hamiltonian cycle of Figure \ref{5g1} in Figure \ref {5g2}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}

  [scale=.6,auto=left,every node/.style={circle,fill=red!20}]

  \node (n2) at (3,7)  {2};
  \node (n4) at (7,7) {4};
  \node (n7) at (9,7)  {7};
  \node (n6) at (5,11)  {6};
   \node (n3) at (5,9) {3};
   \node (n5) at (5,5) {5};
   \node (n8)  at (5,3) {8};
  \foreach \from/\to in {n1/n2,n2/n3,n3/n4,n4/n5,n5/n2,n1/n6,
  n6/n7, n7/n8, n8/n1, n3/n6, n4/n7, n5/n8}
    \draw (\from) -- (\to);

(n8) edge (n1);

Rishnak mentioned that the Hamiltonian cycle problem started
when mathematician Hamilton wanted a cycle to visit 
all the vertices of a Dodecahedron (another platonic solid, like cube) which has 20 vertices and 30 edges. 
Rishnak asked Ajur whether there is a Hamiltonian Cycle in this graph Figure \ref{5g3}. Rishnak added that this is a well known graph known as Petersen Graph.

    \draw (\from) -- (\to);

Ajur thought for a while and he was not able to construct a Hamiltonian cycle. He however, was able to find a 
Hamiltonian Path. So he drew the following Figure \ref{5g4}


\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
  [scale=.5,auto=left,every node/.style={circle,fill=red!20}]
  \node (n1) at (1,7) {1};
  \node (n2) at (5,11)  {2};
  \node (n3) at (9,7)  {3};
  \node (n4) at (9,3) {4};
  \node (n5) at (1,3) {5};
  \node (n6) at (3,7)  {6};
  \node (n7) at (5,8) {7};
  \node (n8)  at (7,7) {8};
  \node (n9) at (7,5) {9};
  \node (n10) at  (3,5) {10};
 
  \foreach \from/\to in {n1/n2,n2/n3,n3/n4,n4/n5,n5/n1,n1/n6,
  n2/n7, n3/n8, n4/n9, n5/n10, n6/n8, n8/n10, n10/n7,n7/n9,n9/n6}
    \draw (\from) -- (\to);
\path[line width=0.35mm,red]

(n2) edge (n3)
(n3) edge (n4)
(n4) edge (n5)

(n8) edge (n6)

Rishnak assured Ajur that Petersen Graph does not have a Hamiltonian Cycle. For testing whether a graph has an Eulerian Cycle or not can easily be tested (the degree of every vertex has to be even), there is no easy method for testing whether a given graph has a Hamiltonian cycle. 
Rishnak continued that there is a special class of graphs called bipartite graphs where every cycle is of even length. The vertex set can be partitioned into
